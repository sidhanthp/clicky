# Hi, this is Clicky.
It's an AI teacher that lives as a buddy next to your cursor. It can see your screen, talk to you, and even point at stuff. Kinda like having a real teacher next to you.

Download it [here](https://www.clicky.so/) for free.

Here's the [original tweet](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/2041314633978659092) that kinda blew up for a demo for more context.

This is the open-source version of Clicky for those that want to hack on it, build their own features, or just see how it works under the hood.

## Get started with Claude Code

The fastest way to get this running is with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

Once you get Claude running, paste this:

```
Hi Claude.

Clone https://github.com/farzaa/clicky.git into my current directory.

Then read the CLAUDE.md. I want to get Clicky running locally on my Mac.

Help me set up everything — the Cloudflare Worker with my own API keys, the proxy URLs, and getting it building in Xcode. Walk me through it.
```

That's it. It'll clone the repo, read the docs, and walk you through the whole setup. Once you're running you can just keep talking to it — build features, fix bugs, whatever. Go crazy.

## Manual setup

If you want to do it yourself, here's the deal.

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.2+ (for ScreenCaptureKit)
- Xcode 15+
- Node.js 18+ (for the Cloudflare Worker)
- A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (free tier works)
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 1. Set up the Cloudflare Worker

The Worker is a tiny proxy that holds your API keys. The app talks to the Worker, the Worker talks to the APIs. This way your keys never ship in the app binary.

```bash
cd worker
npm install
```

Now add your secrets. Wrangler will prompt you to paste each one:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

The worker also exposes non-secret defaults for speech:

```toml
[vars]
OPENAI_TTS_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini-tts"
OPENAI_TTS_VOICE = "cedar"
```

Deploy it:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

It'll give you a URL like `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`. Copy that.

### 2. Run the Worker locally (for development)

If you want to test changes to the Worker without deploying:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler dev
```

This starts a local server (usually `http://localhost:8787`) that behaves exactly like the deployed Worker. You'll need to create a `.dev.vars` file in the `worker/` directory with your keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then set `WorkerBaseURL` in `leanring-buddy/Info.plist` to `http://localhost:8787` while developing locally.

### 3. Update the proxy URLs in the app

Set `WorkerBaseURL` in `leanring-buddy/Info.plist` to your deployed Worker URL, for example:

```xml
<key>WorkerBaseURL</key>
<string>https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev</string>
```

### 4. Open in Xcode and run

```bash
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select the `leanring-buddy` scheme (yes, the typo is intentional, long story)
2. Set your signing team under Signing & Capabilities
3. Hit **Cmd + R** to build and run

The app will appear in your menu bar (not the dock). Click the icon to open the panel, grant the permissions it asks for, and you're good.

### Permissions the app needs

- **Microphone** — for push-to-talk voice capture
- **Accessibility** — for the global keyboard shortcut (Control + Option)
- **Screen Recording** — for taking screenshots when you use the hotkey
- **Screen Content** — for ScreenCaptureKit access

## Architecture

If you want the full technical breakdown, read `CLAUDE.md`. But here's the short version:

**Menu bar app** (no dock icon) with two `NSPanel` windows — one for the control panel dropdown, one for the full-screen transparent cursor overlay. Push-to-talk streams audio to OpenAI Realtime transcription, sends the transcript + screenshot to the OpenAI Responses API via streaming SSE, and plays the response through the OpenAI speech API. The model can embed `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in its responses to make the cursor fly to specific UI elements across multiple monitors.

Push-to-talk streams audio to OpenAI Realtime transcription using a worker-minted ephemeral session, sends the transcript + screenshot to the OpenAI Responses API via streaming SSE, and plays the response through the OpenAI speech API. The model can embed `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in its responses to make the cursor fly to specific UI elements across multiple monitors.
